//! --- Day 9: Explosives in Cyberspace ---
//! 
//! Wandering around a secure area, you come across a datalink port to a new
//! part of the network. After briefly scanning it for interesting files, you
//! find one file in particular that catches your attention. It's compressed
//! with an experimental format, but fortunately, the documentation for the
//! format is nearby.
//! 
//! The format compresses a sequence of characters. Whitespace is ignored. To
//! indicate that some sequence should be repeated, a marker is added to the
//! file, like (10x2). To decompress this marker, take the subsequent 10
//! characters and repeat them 2 times. Then, continue reading the file after
//! the repeated data. The marker itself is not included in the decompressed
//! output.
//! 
//! If parentheses or other characters appear within the data referenced by a
//! marker, that's okay - treat it like normal data, not a marker, and then
//! resume looking for markers after the decompressed section.
//! 
//! For example:
//!     
//!     ADVENT           contains no markers and decompresses to itself with
//!                      no changes, resulting in a decompressed length of 6.
//!     A(1x5)BC         repeats only the B a total of 5 times, becoming
//!                      ABBBBBC for a decompressed length of 7.
//!     (3x3)XYZ         becomes XYZXYZXYZ for a decompressed length of 9.
//!     A(2x2)BCD(2x2)EFG   doubles the BC and EF, becoming ABCBCDEFEFG for a
//!                      decompressed length of 11.
//!     (6x1)(1x3)A      simply becomes (1x3)A - the (1x3) looks like a marker,
//!                      but because it's within a data section of another
//!                      marker, it is not treated any differently from the A
//!                      that comes after it. It has a decompressed length of 6.
//!     X(8x2)(3x3)ABCY  becomes X(3x3)ABC(3x3)ABCY (for a decompressed length
//!                      of 18), because the decompressed data from the (8x2)
//!                      marker (the (3x3)ABC) is skipped and not processed further.
//!     
//! What is the decompressed length of the file (your puzzle input)? Don't
//! count whitespace.
//! 
//! Answer: 110346
//! 
//! --- Part Two ---
//! 
//! Apparently, the file actually uses version two of the format.
//! 
//! In version two, the only difference is that markers within decompressed
//! data are decompressed. This, the documentation explains, provides much
//! more substantial compression capabilities, allowing many-gigabyte files
//! to be stored in only a few kilobytes.
//! 
//! For example:
//!     
//!     (3x3)XYZ still becomes XYZXYZXYZ, as the decompressed section contains no markers.
//!     X(8x2)(3x3)ABCY becomes XABCABCABCABCABCABCY, because the decompressed data from the (8x2) marker is then further decompressed, thus triggering the (3x3) marker twice for a total of six ABC sequences.
//!     (27x12)(20x12)(13x14)(7x10)(1x12)A decompresses into a string of A repeated 241920 times.
//!     (25x3)(3x3)ABC(2x3)XY(5x2)PQRSTX(18x9)(3x2)TWO(5x7)SEVEN becomes 445 characters long.
//!     
//! Unfortunately, the computer you brought probably doesn't have enough
//! memory to actually decompress the file; you'll have to come up with
//! another way to get its decompressed length.
//! 
//! What is the decompressed length of the file using this improved format?
